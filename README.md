Nice — sounds like you’re working on a prompt-engineering lab assignment. I’ll explain each of the four types in simple terms with examples, so you can see the difference clearly.

---

### **1. Straightforward Prompts**

**Definition:**
A direct, simple instruction or question given to the AI, without extra formatting or hidden cues.

**Example:**

> **Prompt:** “Explain photosynthesis in one sentence.”
> **Response:** “Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.”

### **2. Tabular Format Prompting**

**Definition:**
Here, the prompt asks the AI to organize information in a table, which makes data easy to compare and read.

**Example:**

> **Prompt:** “List three planets with their distance from the sun and one unique feature in a table.”
> **Response:**
>
> | Planet  | Distance from Sun (AU) | Unique Feature         |
> | ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
> | Mercury | 0.39                   | Smallest planet        |
> | Venus   | 0.72                   | Hottest planet surface |
> | Earth   | 1.00                   | Supports known life    |

### **3. Missing Word Prompting**

**Definition:**
The AI is given an incomplete sentence or phrase and asked to fill in the missing part. This is useful for language tasks, quizzes, or training completion models.

**Example:**

> **Prompt:** “The capital of France is \_\_\_\_.”
> **Response:** “Paris.”

### **4. Preceding Question Prompting**

**Definition:**
You first ask a preparatory question or give context, and then ask the main question. This helps the AI understand the background and give better answers.

**Example:**

> **Prompt:**
>
> 1. “What is the boiling point of water at sea level?”
> 2. “Now, explain why it changes at higher altitudes.”
>    **Response:**
> 3. “The boiling point of water at sea level is 100°C.”
> 4. “It changes at higher altitudes because lower air pressure reduces the temperature at which water boils.”

Would you like me to combine these explanations and examples into a clean **tabular summary** (type, definition, and example) for easy inclusion in your experiment report?
